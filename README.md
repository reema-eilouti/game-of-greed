# Game of greed

The game requires six standard dice and a pencil and paper for scoring. Each player puts up at least $5 or more in the pot, depending upon the Bet amount. Each player starts out "off the table" with a score of zero. Players collect points during their turn, and either add those points to their cumulative score, or continue rolling with the risk of losing all points accumulated that turn if a scoring combination is not rolled.
